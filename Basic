TITLE: This is the bifactor exploratory factor analysis

DATA:
    FILE IS "LHTLSOnly.csv";		! remember to use the proper drive, back-slash, and data file; all commands end in ;
                    			! here, the data format is fixed file, with each item occupying a column

VARIABLE:
    NAMES ARE v1-v19;
    USEVARIABLES ARE v1-v19;		! you are requesting the program to use Items 1 to 21

ANALYSIS:
    TYPE = EFA 4 4;			! here, the "fg" plus the 3 dimension-specific factors are listed
    ESTIMATOR = MLR;		! here, you are asking for a robust estimator because data is non-normal
    ROTATION = BI-GEOMIN (oblique);	! here, you specify the orthogonal bi-factor rotation
    PARALLEL=50;			! here, you are asking for parallel analysis (PA)

OUTPUT: sampstat;

PLOT: TYPE = PLOT3;		! here, you ask to get both the eigenvalue & PA plot
